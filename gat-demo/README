This directory contains the JavaGAT demos. You can find the 
Java sources in the directory:
 
     ./src 

To build the demos you can use ant. Make sure your ant setup is 
correct by typing:

     echo $ANT_HOME

which should reply:

     /usr/local/VU/practicum/gridcomputing/ant

If you can a different reply (or no reply at all), you should set your 
environment correctly by typing:

    . /usr/local/VU/practicum/gridcomputing/environment 

Then retry the test above. See the web page for more information. 

You can then type

    ant build   to build the demo jar file
    ant clean   to clean the tree

The demos can be run using the "run_demo" script, for example:

    ./run_demo LocalFile       - will run the LocalFile demo

The script expect the class name of the demo you wish to run as a 
parameter (plus any parameters required by the demo). The following
demos are available:
  
    LocalFile          - locally copy "test.in" to "test.copy"
    RemoteFile         - copy "test.in" to the fs4
    RemoteRemoteFile   - copy a file from any DAS site to another
                         (needs file URI's as parameters)

    LocalJob           - run '/bin/hostname -f' locally
    RemoteJob          - run '/bin/hostname -f' on a cluster given
			 as parameter

Enjoy!
