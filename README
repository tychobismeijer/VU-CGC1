This directory contains the JOINC template. You can find the 
Java sources in the directory:
 
     ./src/joinc 

To build Joinc you can use ant. Make sure your ant setup is correct by 
typing:

     echo $ANT_HOME

which should reply:

     /usr/local/VU/practicum/gridcomputing/ant

If you can a different reply (or no reply at all), you should set your 
environment correctly by typing:

    . /usr/local/VU/practicum/gridcomputing/environment 

Then retry the test described above. See the web page for more information. 

You can then type

    ant build   to build the JOINC jar file
    ant clean   to clean the tree
    ant distro  to create a tarball of your JOINC
    ant docs    to generate javadoc for users

Enjoy!
